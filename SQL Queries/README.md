Below are the some questions for which I have perfomed sql queries on that:
* starting with simple overview of dataset present a. columns present in each table b. total customers present c. total products with their categories available
* total cities they are currently operating in

* what are total orders, total orders on time, total orders infull and total orders (on time and infull)(OTIF) by city.
* provide insight regarding the share distribution of previous question metrics by customers.
* calculate % variance between actual and target from on time (OT), infull(IF) and 'ontime and infill'(OTIF) metrics by city
* top/bottom 5 customers by total quantity ordered, in full quantity ordered and 'ontime and infull' quantity ordered
* provide actual OT%, IF%, and OTIF% by customers

* categorize the orders by product category for each customer in descending order
* categorize the orders by product category for each city in descending order
* find top 3 customers from each city based on their total orders and what is their OTIF%
* which product was most and least ordered by each customer
* try to distribute the total product orders by their categories and their % share, also show each city's top and worst selling product.
